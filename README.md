# Fire-Alarm-System-IOT-
This project involves the use of an arduino board to create a home fire alarm system.
When ever a fire is detected in the surrounding, it raises an alarm to alert the people in the environment.

### Devices/Components Used
- Arduino uno R3 Board
- Flame Sensor
- Connecting Wires
- LED
- Buzzer
- Resistor

Fire Alarm Systems are very common in commercial building and factories, these devices usual contain a cluster of sensors that constantly monitors for any flame, gas or fire in the building and triggers an alarm if it detects any of these. One of the simplest way to detect fire is by using an IR Flame sensor, these sensors have an IR photodiode which is sensitive to IR light. Now, in the event of a fire, the fire will not only produce heat but will also emit IR rays, yes every burning flame will emit some level of IR light, this light is not visible to human eyes but our flame sensor can detect it and alert a microcontroller like Arduino that a fire has been detected.
